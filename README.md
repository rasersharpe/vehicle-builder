## Description

Vehicle Builder is a fun vehicle creation and simulation app. If you are into cars or have a collection, then you will enjoy this app. This project tought me about classes and how properties are inherited . Also how they work together along with prompt.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your hard drive and then navigate to the repo in terminal or bash. Then run the command `node i` to install the Inquirer dependancy. Once installed type the command `node index.js`.

## Usage

Once running, you will be asked to either create a new vehicle or choose from the existing vehicles. If you choose to create a new vehicle, you will be prompted to add the vehicle data. Once created, you can simulate vehicle operatations icluding starting the vehicle, accelerating, turning and more.

If you don't want to create a new vehicle, you can choose from the existing ones to simulate with.
